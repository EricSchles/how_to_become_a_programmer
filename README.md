# How to become a programmer

As far as languages go, I'd highly recommend starting off with Python.  It's a really good language (and my personal favorite).  It's the most widely used programming language right now and it's likely to stay that way because of it's flexibility and ease of use.  

So all the resources I will be providing will be in Python.  

Here are some links to classes I've personally taught in the past:

Above is the first lecture in the series.

Here are the class notes for that class:

Next, I'll provide you with some other materials:

1.  MIT - MIT has a number of freely available classes which both introduction Python and programming.  I'd recommend doing these once you finish my class.

https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/

2. Books - Once you have completed these classes I'd recommend reading the following texts:

2a. think Python - http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python/ - you can read it for free on the internet, or buy the physical book

2b. fluent Python - https://www.amazon.com/Fluent-Python-Concise-Effective-Programming/dp/1491946008 - this book you have to buy

3. Advanced Programming concepts: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms - this is a stanford class.  It will give you a good theoretical understanding of algorithms.

4. A historical perspective on computer science: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpIctyqH29Q&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo crash course computer science.  This will give you both a historical perspective and a good hardware level understanding of computer science.

5. Now you are ready for web frameworks!  I'd recommend flask as a first pass: https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world

Then I'd recommend learning Javascript, HTML and CSS.  I don't know a good set of resources for that.  

After that, I'd recommend learning heroku for deployment and finally Amazon Web Services.

I'd say you are ready for a junior role as a developer when you finish 2b.  I'd say you are ready for a senior role when you finish 4.  And you are ready for any role once you understand every concept mentioned here (within software and web development).

I'd also recommend charting your progress on github.  This way you can show people what you are learning as you learn.  I'd also recommend starting a programming blog so you can write about what you learn.  This will also help people understand how you write.

I hope this is helpful!
